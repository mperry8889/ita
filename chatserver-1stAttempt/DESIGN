CHAT SERVER DESIGN NOTES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main() function starts an infinite loop, which waits for incoming connections.  Once
a connection is established, the connection is used to create a new ClientHandler class.

ClientHandler listens for client commands, and interprets them when necessary.
